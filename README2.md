## Install/Setup Instructions

 - Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:
   npm install
 - To verify that it is setup correctly, run npm test in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your Card test file    that show up.
 - Running node index.js from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal:
   Node server running on port 3000
 - Note that you will not need to you run your server until you are instantiating your Game class in Iteration 3. Prior to        that, you should be using TDD to drive your code. You should check the functionality of your application by running your        tests via npm test.
